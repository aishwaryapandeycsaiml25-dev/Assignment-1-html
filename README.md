# Assignment-1-html
This is my first HTML project.Created a homepage for a website using HTML that includes smooth navigation to ABOUT US and CONTACT US pages. This project helped me understand website structure,linking between multiple pages, and building a user-friendly layout.The website structure works smoothly,but I encountered a small issue:the logo is visible when accessed form the homepage(i.e. after clicking on the HOME icon)but does not open correctly when the pages are opened directly due to a relative path problem. This taught me the importance of handling file paths and resource linking carefully in web development. [assignment1.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22328010/assignment1.html)
